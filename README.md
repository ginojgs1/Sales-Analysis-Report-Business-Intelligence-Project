## Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze sales performance across multiple countries, product categories, and time periods using data extracted from a structured PDF report. The goal is to transform static report data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.

Key objectives:
- Identify top-performing products and regions
- Analyze year-over-year (YOY) sales growth
- Understand customer and shipping trends
- Visualize sales distribution and highlight business drivers




### Task / Steps followed

### 1. PDF Data Extraction
- Extracted structured tables and visuals from the PDF using `pdfplumber` and `tabula-py`
- Captured key metrics: Total Sales, Freight, Category Sales, YOY Growth, Top Customers

### 2. Data Cleaning & Structuring
- Converted extracted data into tabular format using **Pandas**
- Standardized country names, product categories, and numerical formats
- Removed duplicates and handled missing/inconsistent entries

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed sales distribution across countries and categories
- Identified top-selling products (e.g., *C√¥te de Blaye*) and comparative performance
- Evaluated YOY growth trends and highlighted outliers

### 4. Visualization & Insights
- Created bar charts, donut charts, and decomposition trees using **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**
- Used bookmarks and filters to explore data by region, category, and shipping method
- Key findings:
  - *C√¥te de Blaye* had 201% higher sales than the lowest-selling product
  - France contributed the highest sales volume
  - Most orders were shipped via *Federal Shipping*

### 5. Forecasting & Recommendations
- Projected future sales trends based on historical growth
- Recommended focus areas for marketing and logistics
- Suggested deeper analysis into freight costs and category performance
